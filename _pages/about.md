Hello, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a Robotics Research Scientist at [NAVER LABS](https://naverlabs.com/en/).

I will be joining Ph.D. program at [MIT CSAIL](https://csail.mit.edu) starting 2023 Fall, working with Professor [Pulkit Agrawal](http://people.csail.mit.edu/pulkitag/). I received my bachelor's degree (*Summa Cum Laude*) in Mechanical Engineering at Seoul National University.

I want to make robots to perform complex manipulation tasks in real-world, that requires both low-level  sensorimotor skills and scene-level reasoning abilities. I just want to make my robot to do some mundane chores for me!

Besides that, I love traveling, playing piano and learning new stuffs.
