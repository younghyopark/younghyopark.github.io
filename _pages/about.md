Hello, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Robotics Research Scientist at [NAVER LABS](https://naverlabs.com/en/), developing machine/reinforcement learning algorithms for robotic manipulation tasks. 

I received my bachelor's degree (*Summa Cum Laude*) in Mechanical Engineering at Seoul National University.

My research interest mainly lies in **data-driven approach for robotic manipulation tasks**: 
learning from demonstrations, unsupervised reinforcement learning (skill discovery) for manipulation tasks i.e,. grapsing/non-prehensile manipulation of rigid/deformable objects.

Besides that, I love traveling, playing piano and learning new stuffs.
