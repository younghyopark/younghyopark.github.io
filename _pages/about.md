Hello, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Robotics Research Scientist in NAVER LABS, working on machine/reinforcement learning algorithms for robotic manipulation tasks.

My research interest mainly lies in data-driven approach for robotic manipulation tasks: 
grasping, learning from demonstrations, unsupervised reinforcement learning (skill discovery) for manipulation tasks.

I received my bachelor's degree (*Summa Cum Laude*) in Mechanical Engineering at Seoul National University in 2022.
Besides that, I love traveling, playing piano and learning new stuffs.
