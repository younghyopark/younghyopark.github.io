  abstract={
Recent progress in unsupervised skill discovery algorithms has shown great promise in learning an extensive collection of behaviors without extrinsic supervision. On the other hand, safety is one of the most critical factors for real-world robot applications. As skill discovery methods typically encourage exploratory and dynamic behaviors, it can often be the case that a large portion of learned skills remains too dangerous and unsafe. In this paper, we introduce the novel problem of safe skill discovery, which aims at learning, in a task-agnostic fashion, a repertoire of reusable skills that is inherently safe to be composed for solving downstream tasks. We propose Safety-Guaranteed Skill Discovery (SGSD), an algorithm that learns a latent-conditioned skill-policy, regularized with a safety-critic modeling a user-defined safety definition. Using the pretrained safe skill repertoire, hierarchical reinforcement learning can solve downstream tasks without the need of explicit consideration of safety during training and testing. We evaluate our algorithm on a collection of force-controlled robotic manipulation tasks in simulation and show promising downstream task performance with safety guarantees.

  abstract={
  Robotic painting tasks in the real world are often made complicated by the highly complex and stochastic nature of the dynamics that underlie, e.g., physical contact between the painting tool and a canvas, color blendings between painting mediums, and many more. Simulation-based inverse graphics algorithms, for example, can not be directly transferred to the real-world due in large to the considerable gap in the viable range of painting strokes the robot can accurately generate onto the physical canvas. In this paper, we aim at minimizing this gap by appealing to a data-driven skill learning approach. The core idea lies in allowing the robot to learn continuous stroke-level skills that jointly encodes action trajectories and painted outcomes from an extensive collection of human demonstrations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through extensive real-world experiments using a 4-dof torque-controllable manipulator with a digital canvas(iPad).
